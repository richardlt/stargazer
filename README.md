<h2>What is it?</h2>
An application that gives you some statistics about your public Github repositories, including: stars evolution count of stars for last days and more.
<h2>How it works?</h2>
Open Stargazer web page then enter your repository path. Owner of the target repository should have starred the Stargazer project to enable stats computing. For organization's repositories, one of the top 3 contributors should have starred the Stargazer project and should be a member of the organization.

Only public repository can be analyzed by Stargazer. Stats will be automatically updated when opening the page, this can be perfomed only one time each 24h (default period).
<h2>I don't want to see my stats anymore?</h2>
You can simply remove your star on the Stargazer project to trigger stats deletion.
